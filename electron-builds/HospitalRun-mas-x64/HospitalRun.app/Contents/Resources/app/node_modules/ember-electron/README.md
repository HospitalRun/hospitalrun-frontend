<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felixrieseberg/ember-electron/master/logo.gif" alt="Logo" align="right" /> This addon enables the development of Desktop apps with Ember, Ember Cli, and GitHub's Electron. It enables live development with Electron (similar to `ember serve`) as well as testing in Electron (similar to `ember test` and `ember test --server`). It also comes with an integrated packager, turning your Ember App into standalone binaries for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It also integrates the famous Ember Inspector. The commands are:

* `ember electron` - Run app in Electron with live-reload server
* `ember electron:test` - Test the app using Electron
* `ember electron:test --server` - Test with Electron in development server mode
* `ember electron:package` - Create binaries (.app, .exe, etc) for your app

Ember-Electron builds on prior work done by @brzpegasus (author of [`ember-cli-nwjs`](https://github.com/brzpegasus/ember-cli-nwjs)) and @joostdevries (author of [`ember-cli-remote-inspector`](https://github.com/joostdevries/ember-cli-remote-inspector)).

To see a real world example, check out [Ghost Desktop](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost-Desktop).

## Installation and Usage
> :warning: This addon needs at least Node 6.

To install the addon, run:
```
ember install ember-electron
```

Or, to install with npm - but please ensure (:warning:) that the blueprint generation runs - it creates necessary files and configuration for this addon to work. Please ensure that your `tests` folder contains a `package.json` and a `electron.js` - and that `locationType` in `config/environment.js` is set to `hash`.
```
npm install ember-electron
ember g ember-electron
```

Once you installed the addon, you'll notice that a new file called `electron.js` was created in the root folder of your application. This is the entry point for Electron and is responsible for creating browser windows and other interactions with Electron APIs.

### Configuration and First Use
To run your app together with a file watcher in development mode (similar to `ember serve`), you can run  `ember electron`. However, you will need to change your configuration for Ember and Electron to work well together: Electron does not support the History API. Therefore Ember-Cli must be configured to use the `hash` location type. Update your `config/environment.js`'s `locationType` config option to `hash`. If you would like to support running the app both within and outside of Electron you can use the following switch:

```js
  locationType: process.env.EMBER_CLI_ELECTRON ? 'hash' : 'auto',
```

## Ember Inspector
If you're running a later version of Electron, you will notice that ember-electron installs ember-inspector directly into Electron. Simply open up the developer tools and choose the Ember-tab, just like you would in Chrome.

In addition, Whenever you run `ember electron`, the console output will give you a URL where Ember Inspector is live. Communication between your app in Electron and the Ember Inspector happens over WebSockets. By default, the console output should look like this:

```
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ember Inspector running on http://localhost:30820
Open the inspector URL in a browser to debug the app!
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting Electron...
--------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Testing
To test your app, run `ember electron:test`. If you prefer the live-reload mode, run `ember electron:test --server`. The usual parameters are supported:

* `--server` - Run tests in interactive mode (default: false)
* `--protocol` - 'The protocol to use when running with --server (default: 'http')
* `--host` - The host to use when running with --server (default: 'localhost')
* `--port` - The port to use when running with --server (default: 7357)
* `--module` - The name of a test module to run
* `--filter` - A string to filter tests to run

## Packaging
Ember-Electron comes with an integrated packager to create binaries (.app, .exe etc), which can be run with `ember electron:package`. By default, the packager creates binaries for all platforms and architectures using your app's name and version as defined in `package.json`. Under the hood, it uses the popular [electron-packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager) module.

To create standalone binaries of your Ember App, simply run the following command.
```
ember electron:package
```

### Defining Files to Package
By default, ember-electron will package your whole `dist` folder and all production dependencies as defined in `package.json`. In addition, to ensure that Electron can start properly, it also includes `electron.js` and `package.json`. To configure which files make it into the package, use the `copy-files` property the ember-electron section in your `package.json`. Globs are accepted!

```json
"ember-electron": {
  "copy-files": [
    "package.json",
    "electron.js",
    "main/*"
  ],
}
```

### Configuration
You can pass options to the packager by either putting configuration into your app's `package.json`, or by passing a command line parameter to the `ember electron:package` command. You can extend your existing `package.json` with all available configuration options by running `ember generate ember-electron`. In the case that an option is defined both on the command line and in the package.json, the command line option will be used.

* `--app-copyright` - *String* The human-readable copyright line for the app. Maps to the LegalCopyright metadata property on Windows, and NSHumanReadableCopyright on OS X.
* `--app-version` - *String* The release version of the application. Maps to the `ProductVersion` metadata property on Windows, and `CFBundleShortVersionString` on OS X.
* `--arch` - *String* Allowed values: *ia32, x64, all*

* `--asar` - *Boolean* Whether to package the application's source code into an archive, using [Electron's archive format](https://github.com/atom/asar). Reasons why you may want to enable this feature are described in [an application packaging tutorial in Electron's documentation](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.36.0/tutorial/application-packaging/). Defaults to `false`.

  - `ordering` - *String*: A path to an ordering file for packing files. An explanation can be found on the [Atom issue tracker](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10163).
  - `unpack` - *String*: A [glob expression](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#features), when specified, unpacks the file with matching names to the `app.asar.unpacked` directory.
  - `unpackDir` - *String*: Unpacks the dir to the `app.asar.unpacked` directory whose names exactly or pattern match this string. The `asar.unpackDir` is relative to `dir`.

  For example, `asar-unpack-dir=sub_dir` will unpack the directory `/<dir>/sub_dir`.

* `--build-version` - *String* The build version of the application. Maps to the `FileVersion` metadata property on Windows, and `CFBundleVersion` on OS X.
* `--copy-dev-modules` - *Boolean* Copy dependency node modules from local dev node_modules instead of installing them.

* `--defer-symlinks` - *Boolean* Whether symlinks should be dereferenced during copying (defaults to true)
* `--download` - *Object* If present, passes custom options to [`electron-download`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-download)
(see the link for more detailed option descriptions and the defaults).

  - `cache` *String*: The directory where prebuilt, pre-packaged Electron downloads are cached.
  - `mirror` *String*: The URL to override the default Electron download location.
  - `strictSSL` *Boolean*: Whether SSL certificates are required to be valid when downloading Electron.

* `--dir` - *String* The source directory

* `--icon` - *String* Currently you must look for conversion tools in order to supply an icon in the format required by the platform. If the file extension is omitted, it is auto-completed to the correct extension based on the platform.

  - OS X: `.icns`
  - Windows: `.ico` ([See below](#building-windows-apps-from-non-windows-platforms) for details on non-Windows platforms)
  - Linux: this option is not required, as the dock/window list icon is set via [the icon option in the BrowserWindow contructor](http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.30.0/api/browser-window/#new-browserwindow-options). Setting the icon in the file manager is not currently supported.

* `--ignore` - *RegExp* A pattern which specifies which files to ignore when copying files to create the package(s). Take note that Ember Electron creates a temp folder containing `electron.js`, `package.json`, and Ember Cli's `dist` output folder. Glob patterns will not work.
* `--name` - *String* The application name.
* `--out` - *String* The directory where electron builds are saved. Defaults to `electron-builds/`.
* `--overwrite` - *Boolean* Whether to replace an already existing output directory for a given platform (`true`) or skip recreating it (`false`). Defaults to `false`.

For example, `app-category-type=public.app-category.developer-tools` will set the application category to *Developer Tools*. Valid values are listed in [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009250-SW8).
* `--extend-info` - *String* Filename of a plist file; the contents are added to the app's plist. Entries in `extend-info` override entries in the base plist file supplied by electron-prebuilt, but are overridden by other explicit arguments such as `app-version` or `app-bundle-id`.
* `--extra-resource` - *String* Filename of a file to be copied directly into the app's Contents/Resources directory.
* `--helper-bundle-id` - *String* The bundle identifier to use in the application helper's plist.

# Advanced Usage

## Running CI Tests on Travis CI, Circle CI, Jenkins and other headless systems
You can test your application using Electron with the `ember electron:test` command. However, because Chromium requires a display to work, you will need to create a fake display during your test in a headless environment like Travis CI or Circle CI. This addon automatically configures `.travis.yml`, but if you'd like to configure it manually, ensure that you take the following steps:

 * Install [`xvfb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb). It's a virtual framebuffer, implementing the X11 display server protocol - it performs all graphical operations in memory without showing any screen output, which is exactly what we need. A [Jenkins addon is available](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Xvfb+Plugin).
 * Create a virtual `xvfb` screen and export an environment variable called `DISPLAY` that points to it. Electron will automatically pick it up.
 * Install a recent C++ compiler (e.g. gcc). This is to enable the CI server to build native modules for Node.js.
 * Finally, ensure that `npm test` actually calls `ember electron:test`. You can configure what command `npm test executes` by changing it in your `package.json`.

On Travis, the configuration should look like this:

```
env:
  - CXX=g++-4.8

addons:
  apt:
    sources:
      - ubuntu-toolchain-r-test
    packages:
      - xvfb
      - g++-4.8

before_install:
  - "npm config set spin false"

install:
  - npm install -g bower
  - npm install
  - bower install
  - export DISPLAY=':99.0'
  - Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

## Conflict between Ember and Electron: require()
Both Ember Cli and Node.js use `require()`. Without ember-electron, Ember will start and overwrite Node's `require()` method, meaning that you're stuck without crucial tools such as `require('electron')`.

When using ember-electron, this conflict is automatically managed for you - you can continue to use Ember's `require()` for Ember Cli modules, but also use `requireNode()` for Node modules. The same is true for `window.module` (which is available as `window.moduleNode`) and `window.process` (which is available as `window.processNode`).

In addition, the `require()` method is overwritten to resolve both AMD and Node modules (see below) - however, to maintain code sanity, I recommend using `require()` and `requireNode()`.

## Creating Installers
Ember-Electron does currently not create installers for you, but plenty of modules exist to automate this task. For Windows installers, GitHub's very own [grunt-electron-installer](https://github.com/atom/grunt-electron-installer) does a great job. On OS X, you probably want to create a pretty DMG image - [node-appdmg](https://github.com/LinusU/node-appdmg) is a great command line tool to create images. If you'd like to follow GitHub's lead and stick with Grunt, consider [grunt-appdmg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-appdmg)
